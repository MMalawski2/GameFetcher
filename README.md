# GameFetcher

Desktop app written in WPF (MVVM pattern)

In this App you can browse games info from IGDB API and add picked games to your personal lists (Stored in SQLite). 
Rate games, pick which what platform you are playing on, find out if release dates changed and keep track if you played/are playing/will play game.

I implemented API connection to my WebApi project (https://github.com/Yashu7/WebCrawlerAPI) which tells if particular Nintendo Switch games 
are on sale but WebApi is offline at the moment. I also plan on doing to for more platforms.

WHAT YOU NEED:
.NET Framework 4.7.2
